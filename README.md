# Sim2Real_Report
Sim2Real robot learning is an innovative field
that aims to train robots in simulated environments and transfer their acquired skills to
real-world applications. By combining simulation, machine learning, and robotics, Sim2Real
robot learning tackles the challenges associated
with training in real-world scenarios. This comprehensive report explores the core concepts
and methodologies of Sim2Real robot learning,
covering essential topics such as reinforcement
learning, evolutionary robotics, simulators, domain adaptation, domain randomization, and
meta learning. It delves into the advantages
and limitations of simulation-based training,
addressing the reality gap between simulations
and real-world environments. The report highlights the importance of domain adaptation and
domain randomization techniques in minimizing the discrepancies between simulated and
real-world performance.
